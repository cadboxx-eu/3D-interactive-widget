# aframe object showcase

A little proof of concept, this project uses the aframe javascript library to create an interactive room, using many custom *components* and *animations*, and fun and cool things like *objects* that have *textures*!

There is much documentation in both the `.php` files, as well as `main.js`, so feel free to poke around and learn how it works!

### Disclaimer

A lot of this code is based on code that written in a hurry and I learned on the fly, so you may find much of the code improvised, WET and maybe not terribly ideal :)

#### OH!

Still not using a lick of jQuery!
